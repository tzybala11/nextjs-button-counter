Next.JS Button Counter Project

This project is intended to be an introduction to Next.JS and React. It makes use of a local web server to host a webpage that can be used to display interactive information using JS, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, etc..

First to start you need npm, which means you need to go to your terminal and type in 'npm install'.

The way to run this locally is to go to your computer's local terminal and find the folder for the app and then type in 'npm run dev' to start up the server and then type into a web browser 'https://localhost:3000' and it will load up the webpage.

To build the project you need to type into the terminal 'npm run build' and then to start the server 'npm start'.

The features of this project are a counter component that displays the current count and allows you to add or subtract from that counter. Additionally, you are able to reset the counter back to the default value. A step is also included to act as a multiplier for each instance the add/subtract button is clicked. Moreover, the buttons have clear text labels that are easily visible and there is also a disable decrement to make sure the count cannot go below 0. Lastly, there is a rendered counter that is at its default settings and one that has custom settings. Everything is clearly labeled and the CSS is meant to be simple and intuitive.
